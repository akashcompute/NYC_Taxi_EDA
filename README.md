### Project README: Optimizing NYC Taxi Operations

This README provides an overview of the exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on NYC taxi trip data. The analysis aims to uncover actionable insights for optimizing taxi operations, improving service efficiency, and maximizing revenue.

### Project Overview

* **Objective:** To analyze a large dataset of NYC Yellow Taxi trips from 2023 to identify patterns and trends that can inform strategic decisions for a taxi operation.
* **Problem Statement:** As an analyst for a new taxi company in NYC, the task is to use data-driven insights to optimize operations and improve competitiveness.
* **Methodology:**
    * **Data Preparation:** Due to the massive size of the full-year dataset, a **stratified sampling technique** was employed. The data was sampled by date and hour from the `tpep_pickup_datetime` column to ensure all time periods were proportionally represented.
    * **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The analysis focused on understanding trip patterns, fare structures, and tip behaviors.
    * **Tools:** Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib were used to clean, analyze, and visualize the data.

### Key Findings & Actionable Insights

Based on the analysis, here are the key insights that can help a taxi operation optimize its business:

* **Shared Rides:** There is a strong correlation between passenger count and fare, indicating a missed opportunity for shared-ride strategies. Proposing a **"Group Rate" flat fee** or **"Shared Ride Discounts"** could increase revenue and improve vehicle utilization.
* **Optimizing Fare Structure:** The analysis revealed that the fare-per-mile varies significantly for short and long trips. A **tiered pricing model** should be considered to remain competitive.
* **Surcharge Communication:** The analysis showed that most surcharges are applied universally. Clear communication with customers about these charges is essential to prevent "bill shock" and maintain a positive passenger experience.
